    <h2>The tale of Herbet Gruel</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my story. I am a slight whisp of a man, slender and fragile, features wrinkled and worn, eyes sunken into their sockets like rabbits cowering in their burrows. The <em>years have not been kind to me</em>, but yet I hold no regrets, as I have overcome all that sought to ail me, and have been allowed to bide my time, making mischief as I travel to and fro, 'cross the unyielding landscape of the <a href="http://outer-rim-rocks.co.uk">outer rim</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>Buster</h3>
    <p>Buster is my guardian angel. Before that, he was my dog. Before that, who knows? I lost my dog many moons ago while out hunting geese in the undergrowth. A shot rang out from my rifle, and I called for Buster to collect the goose I had felled. He ran off towards where the bird had landed, but never returned. I never found his body, but I comfort myself with the thought that he did not die; rather he transcended to a higher place, and now watches over me, to ensure my well-being.</p>
    
    <h3>My possessions</h3>
    <p>A travelling man needs very little to accompany him on the road:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>My hat full of memories</li>
      <li>My trusty walking cane</li>
      <li>A purse that did contain gold at one time</li>
      <li>A diary, from the year 1874</li>
      <li>An empty glasses case</li>
      <li>A newspaper, for when I need to look busy</li>
    </ul>
