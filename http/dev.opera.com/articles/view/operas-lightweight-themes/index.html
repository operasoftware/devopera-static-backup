      <h1>Opera's lightweight themes</h1>
      <p class="print author">By Chris Mills</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
	
<p>Opera 12 brings us many improvements, including updates to the Opera skinning system. For a start, the updates are so extensive that we have renamed skins to <strong>themes</strong>. There is a new lightweight system that sits on top of the default Opera theme and makes simple customizations much easier to achieve. In this article we&#39;ll take a look at how this lightweight system works.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>These new lightweight themes work in the same way as the existing themes system: they are packaged in a ZIP file, and contain two things, assets that you want to use in your theme, and a persona.ini file. The .ini file is how Opera recognises the ZIP file as a theme — when it encounters such a file (eg by following a link to it), it will automatically install the theme: a nice simple process. The theme applies is applied on top of the default Opera skin for your OS.</p>

<p>The persona.ini file contains a number of sections, each begun by a heading contained in square brackets, like so: [Options]. Each of these sections contains information to specify different parts of the theme, such as a custom background image, etc. the key here is simplicity — you can still use the old heavyweight theme system to create a full customization if you want, but a lot of people just want to do something simple, and don&#39;t want to risk breaking the UI. The lightweight system is much easier to use. In <a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/next/">Opera 12</a> we are only allowing you to customize the background image, colorization, and which major parts of the UI the image shows through. More options may be added in the future.</p>

<p>In the next section we will run through a complete theme example to show how this all works.</p>

<h2>Walking through an example</h2>

<p>To try out an example theme, install <a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/next/">Opera 12</a> and point it at our <a href="https://addons.opera.com/themes/">Opera themes page</a>. Try clicking on one of the examples and you&#39;ll notice that your browser changes its style to look something like the following:</p>

<p><img src="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/6362/theme1.jpg" alt="A sample Opera lightweight theme applied to Opera 12" /></p>
<p class="comment">Figure 1: An example theme in action.</p>

<p class="note">You will find this theme listed along with any other themes you may have installed, in <em>Tools &gt; Appearance</em>. From these you can choose to select between the different ones you&#39;ve previously installed, or delete them. You can also make a theme available from the appearance dialog by placing it in the <em>skin</em> directory of your Opera profile. You can find this in <em>[home folder]/Library/Opera</em> on Mac and Linux, and <em>C:\users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\Opera\Opera</em> on Windows.</p>

<p>I have made an <a href="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/6362/natural_history_of_norway.zip">Opera theme available for you to play with</a>. If you save the ZIP file to your machine, then unzip it, you&#39;ll find assets, plus the personas.ini file, which contains the following sections:</p>

<pre><code># This file describes a test persona for the Opera browser. Not meant for redistribution.</code></pre>

<p>This is a comment, to give some background information about the theme. You can put comments anywhere you like in the file, as long as they are written on a separate line and started with a hash/pound symbol (#).</p>

<pre><code>[Info]
Name                          = The Natural History of Norway
Author                        = Opera Software
Version                       = 1
Preview Image                 =</code></pre>

<p>The <code>[Info]</code> section is quite self explanatory. The <code>Name</code> is the name of the theme, as it will appear in the Appearance dialog, on the upcoming Opera themes catalog, etc. The <code>Author</code> is the author of the theme, and <code>Version</code> should always be set as 1 (this means &quot;version 1 of the lightweight theme system&quot;). Preview Image is supposed to provide a preview for catalogs, etc., but is not currently being used.</p>

<pre><code>[Options]
Tint Color                = #3e6da9</code></pre>

<p>An optional section: if specified, <code>Tint Color</code> overrides the current colorization with a specific color tint — we colorize with the average colour of the image. Some of the themes, when installed, will add a colouration/tint over the top of the theme.</p>

<p class="note"><code>Tint Color</code> has an alias, <code>Colorize Color</code>, which you can use instead, but I think you&#39;ll agree that <code>Tint Color</code> is a bit more intuitive.</p>

<pre><code>[Window Image]
Type                          = BestFit
Background                = Kraken.jpg
Colorize                      = 0</code></pre>

<p>The <code>[Window Image]</code> section controls settings of the whole browser window. The <code>Type</code> is set to <code>BestFit</code> to indicate that Opera will fit a single copy of the image in the best way it can. The other available setting is BoxTile, which tiles the image. The <code>Background</code> line specifies the path to the image that will be used as a custom background image for the theme. <code>Colorize = 0</code> specifies that you don&#39;t want the custom image colorized in the same way as the rest of the UI. Set it to <code>1</code> if you do.</p>

<p class="note">Note: The overall size of the theme should not exceed 1MB, therefore you should be careful with the size of your background image, and try to optimize it down using an application such as <a href="http://imageoptim.com/">ImageOptim</a>.</p>

<pre><code>[Clear elements]
Speed Dial Widget Blank Skin  = 1
Speed Dial Widget Skin        = 1</code></pre>

<p>Setting these properties all to <code>1</code> will cause the background image to shine through the speed dial. If they are missing or set to 0, it won&#39;t.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t do much else inside lightweight themes, although we may add more options later. This sounds limiting, you might say, but this is deliberate — themes are for applying small changes. If you want to make more extensive changes, you&#39;ll still use the full theming system. But this new way is a lot simpler to write and apply.</p>

<h2>Installing and sharing a theme</h2>

<p>When you&#39;ve created a theme, you&#39;ll want to share it with others so they can see your handiwork. The best way to do this is to upload it to our Themes repository — to do this, use our <a href="https://addons.opera.com/en/developer/upload/">Opera addons developer upload page.</a> You&#39;ll need a <a href="http://my.opera.com/community/">my.opera</a> user account to do so. Sharing your theme like this means that it will be easily findable by others, and our team will also check it thoroughly for errors before making it public.</p>

<p>Note that if you instead upload it to your own web server, you&#39;ll need to make sure you serve it with the correct mime type, otherwise it won&#39;t install. To do this, put the following inside an <code>.htaccess</code> file in the same directory (for an Apache-based server, of course — other server types will require a different but equivalent fix):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;files *.zip&gt;
  ForceType application/x-opera-configuration-skin
&lt;/files&gt;</code></pre>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I hope you found our walkthrough of Opera lightweight themes helpful. Let us know what you think!</p>

      <section class="commentcontent"><span class="bubble-arrow"></span>@Jim the eventual idea is that you will be able to apply a customized skin, and then put a theme over the top of that, to provide a little more tweaking and customization. For those of us who just want to add a different background image, and don&#39;t want to wade through the skinning process, themes make things easier. I think it adds an extra level of flexibility. Does this help you with the idea?<br/><br/>Please feel free to share your thoughts in more detail - it is always useful to get this kind of feedback. </section>

      <section class="commentcontent"><span class="bubble-arrow"></span>I am afraid this will further kill skinning. Back in the day it was way simpler to edit a skin. Skins were unique. Call me a fossil or compare recent skins with those published 4-5 yrs ago. <br/>It&#39;s like car models aerodynamics made them all look alike. Thanks to windows 7 and its transparency thing, which I never liked, this was the only direction to take I guess. I hope a handful designs that I like keep working with the new versions.</section>

      <section class="commentcontent"><span class="bubble-arrow"></span>@cethoss the classic opera skinning system is not going to be killed - skins and themes will work side by side. The idea is that eventually you will install a skin, and then you can put a theme over the top of that, to further customise the skin, adding a custom graphic or tint. I&#39;m sorry this was not made clearer, and hope that clarifies things somewhat.</section>

      <section class="commentcontent"><span class="bubble-arrow"></span>Is it currently possible for a theme to adopt the color scheme that the skin has been tinted with? It would be nice for skins and themes to be found under separate tabs (and folders). Presently, a custom skin and a theme can both be loaded but it requires either editing operaperfs.ini or selecting a skin with OK and then highlight a theme and then closing the appearance dialog with the X button. Is an easier method coming?</section>

      <section class="commentcontent"><span class="bubble-arrow"></span>I&#39;m seeing an issue with how text is displayed with the new themes... <br/><br/>Let&#39;s say you use a really dark photo for the background of the theme then you look at the page title. Its completely unreadable. This is the same with tabs.<br/><br/>Shouldn&#39;t there be a text colour associated with the theme itself? <br/>Rather than using a skin which changes the text colour then applying a theme over that which could have the same problems. (apply dark skin with white text then add a bright coloured theme.) </section>

      <section class="commentcontent"><span class="bubble-arrow"></span>I like the new theme possibility, because it won&#39;t break with an update.<br/>But what I don&#39;t understand: Why not make is a configurable preference?<br/>It&#39;s just a image file with four settings. Why isn&#39;t there a preference for theming, a possibility to drag and drop a image file and play with the colour settings, that&#39;s much easier then wrapping it all up in a zip file. <br/><br/>I wasn&#39;t aware of the appearance  menu option for a long time because I was using a different skin. :)<br/>Why isn&#39;t there any setting for appearance/skin in the preference section. A user should be able to skin/theme everything except the preference dialogues, which should offer access to any setting IMHO, also theming/skinning<br/></section>

      <section class="commentcontent"><span class="bubble-arrow"></span>OK,<br/>I tried several &quot;themes&quot; and all of them look really like a &quot;skins&quot;.<br/>I mean, what previously was called &quot;skin&quot; in fact was a theme <br/>because it contained elements to change almost everything.<br/>But now the &quot;themes&quot; I tried change only SpeedDial and menu backgrounds.<br/>And color for panels.<br/>That&#39;s it!?<br/>So I would call them - skins.<br/></section>

      <section class="commentcontent"><span class="bubble-arrow"></span>Where is there an app or tutorial about how to create skins ....... the old way. I don&#39;t mean the current themes where you change a background picture. How to build a skin where you can use icon or images to change the back button and other buttons, layout and such. <br/><br/>Konic: I think you have it backwards. You should really look up the def of the words skin and theme. Thems are a lot like &#39;Styles&#39; in windows where you can change background pictures of the desktop and font size and color and maybe border widths. Skins are overlays which in essence completely cover an application and change the whole look and you can change the buttons, layout, feel and everything.</section>

      <section class="commentcontent"><span class="bubble-arrow"></span>Since 12.10, Opera has ignored my settings for [Speed Dial Widget Blank Skin]. I usually clone [Speed Dial Widget Blank Skin] to [Speed Dial Widget Skin] to avoid having a glaring white screen. Is there any way to add a background to a blank page or is this a new feature?<br/><br/>Couple this with the fact that when Speed Dial is hidden, there no longer is a &quot;show speed dial&quot; button on a blank page.  I can get it to show using a Speed Dial button but this adds an unnecessary click.<br/></section>
